=========

This repository contains code and ecoregion lookup files that are useful for 
developing reclassifications of the terrestrial ecoregions generated by the
World Wildlife Fund (WWF).  The primary purpose of this reclassification is to
provide fewer categories of biomes so that future analyses are more tractable. It
was developed by Dan McGlinn and Cody Hincliff.

To visiually inspect the reclassification scheme see the output maps here:
