Issues:

* Send Mark, Ian an email re this:
- In particular, classification of SE Australian forests, mediterranean zones

Transition zones exist between:
- Temperate deciduous and tropical forest (NE Asia)
- Tropical and temperate grassland (Australia)

Other issues:
- Pakistan is a disaster: it is entirely classified as desert. Oh well.
